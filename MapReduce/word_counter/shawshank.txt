 One in particular.
 It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
 It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
 It's where I asked my wife to marry me.
 We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak and I asked and she said yes.
 Promise me, Red. If you ever get out... find that spot.
 At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.
 Piece of black, volcanic glass. There's something buried under it I want you to have.
