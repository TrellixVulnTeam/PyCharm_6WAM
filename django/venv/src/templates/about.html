        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <p class="lead">Most people go home after work in about 2 hours sharing limited traffic resources.
                        It is both time and gas consuming while get stuck in a heavy traffic. In addition, accidents are
                        more likely to happen with rushing car flows.
                        <br/><br/>

                        This app is designed to help people predict the best route and time for outing, which optimizes
                        the traffic load and time people spend on the way.
                        Users may plan the time to leave office in advance.
                        Suggested path and time will be presented to users based on their preference.
